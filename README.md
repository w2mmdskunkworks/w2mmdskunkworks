The Skunkworks advanced projects team is a group of members of the Gloucester County ARC who recognized a common passion
for developing projects using new computing and communications technologies and who work together developing projects in
these areas. Many of our projects utilize various iterations of the popular Raspberry Pi computers as well as low-cost 
software-defined radios such as the rtl-sdr and SDR Play units.  Most of our projects are housed in the GCARC Clubhouse, a dedicated
building housing complete HF, VHF and satellite ham stations for member use.

We also occasionally host programs on various technical topics at the GCARC “Tech Saturday” events that are held at the
Clubhouse on the first Saturday that follows the first Wednesday of the month. The GCARC meetings occur on the first Wednesday
of the month. For information about GCARC meetings see the GCARC website.
